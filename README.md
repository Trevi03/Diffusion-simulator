# Diffusion-simulator
Programming 2 Assignment 2

The task involves creating an M by N array, space, which contains value states (a float value between 0.0 and 1.0). This state value represents the normalised density of a diffusing material. For example, a state of 1.0 represents a high concentration of the material and 0.0 represents no presence of the material.
The simulation will use a modified Diffusion equation to describe how the material diffuses through space and time. It will also require an initial condition (the initial state of the space) and how to handle the boundaries of the space (left, right, top, and bottom borders).
The class Diffusion should be used to simulate how particles diffuse in space.
